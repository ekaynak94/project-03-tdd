## Personal Experience

This was my first time experiencing what test-driven develepment and behavious driven-development processes look like. Implementing an algorithm in this fashion made me realize thinking and considering test cases before implementing not only make me save time because it gives me a better understanding of what exactly I am implementing, how it should function and what I should be doing while coding for it, but also made my code much more error proof.
